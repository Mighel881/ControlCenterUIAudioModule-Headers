# CCUIAudioModule Headers

Extracted ControlCenterUIAudioModule Headers... These headers are useful for those wanting to port the iOS 13 volume hud (which I am currently doing and have been since June 3, 2019 at 1:11 am :P)  or modify the Control Center Volume Module.... Anyways I thought I'd dump them and share them here.

# No Legal Actions needed :P
